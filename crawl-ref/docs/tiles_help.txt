                  !!!IMPORTANT!!!

If you keep experiencing crashes in the 0.8 development version, you can set
some options to make Crawl more stable:

tile_force_regenerate_levels = true

If you're getting inexplicable crashes when loading a recent save file, try
setting this option to true. It will cause the tiles information of existing
levels to be regenerated, dumping the corrupt level information that's
causing the crashes and enabling you to continue your game.


tile_allow_detached_montab = false

If you keep getting crashes while the monster tab is open, try setting this
option to false.

                  Tiles suggestions

Crawl renders its graphics using OpenGL and SDL.  However, it needs hardware
acceleration to not run slowly.  If you are on Windows, make sure to update
your graphics card driver.  If you are on Linux, be sure that you are using DRI.

It has been tested successfully with cards as old as the i865.  Unfortunately,
it has been known to be slow on the i810 and there is little to be done in that
case but to run the console version instead or switch to a different machine.

You can try tweaking a number of options to see whether performance improves:

tile_title_screen = false
    For weak drivers, the title screen can take a long time to load. If this
    bothers you, you can easily deactivate it.

travel_delay = -1
    This setting suppresses redrawing until travelling is finished or
    interrupted.

tile_update_rate = 1000
    By default, the screen gets redrawn at least every 1000 milliseconds,
    more often if you take actions that change the display. You could try
    cranking up this value, though this may lead to updating taking too long.

tile_runrest_rate = 100
    While running and resting the screen is redraw every 100 milliseconds.
    If Crawl is slow while running or resting, increase this number.

tile_tooltip_ms = 0
    Deactivating the tooltips means there's less stuff to draw every time.

clear_map = false
    Not having to redraw remembered monsters outside your line of sight
    takes some load off the redrawing routines.

tile_window_width   = 1024
tile_window_height  = 768
    The larger the map area the more cells there are to redraw each turn.
    If you've got a large display showing way more than the necessary 17x17
    grids of the map, you could try specifying a lower resolution.
