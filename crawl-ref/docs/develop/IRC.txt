Developers on IRC
=================

Some of the Crawl developers hang out on the ##crawl-dev IRC channel on
freenode (irc://freenode/##crawl-dev). You can ask them development related
questions. Users with +v are the people with commit access.

If you have a patch which is ready to commit, submitting it as a Github Pull
Request will result in an IRC message about the PR.

If you notice a bug, posting a report on Github will post the report to IRC.
