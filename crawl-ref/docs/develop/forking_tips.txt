You want to create your own Stone Soup offshoot? Cool. Here's some helpful advice:

* Try to think of something interesting and compelling that your fork will contain.
  People can just play older versions of Crawl, if your elevator pitch that consists of "reintroduce old content".

* Clone the repo, then upload that to github/gitlab/whatever.
  Don't clone the repo on GitHub; you won't be able to search through files or commits.

* Increment "tag major", it will simplify your life. (XXX - how?)

* If you use upstream commits after you start hacking on your fork, "merge" strategy will work better than "rebase".
