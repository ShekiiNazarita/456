tutorial5 start

In this lesson you're going to learn about gods and how to use their powers.
%%%%
tutorial5 secret_door

There's got to be an entrance to the temple! Try searching
the glass walls for secret doors with $cmd[CMD_REST]<localtiles> or
by <w>mouseclick</w> in the command panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial5 dungeon_overview

Trog is just one of many gods. In a real game, you check
$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_OVERMAP]<localtiles> or click on the <w>dungeon overmap
button</w> in the command panel</localtiles>
for a list of all altars and other interesting features found so far.
%%%%
tutorial5 altar

You can pray on an altar with $cmd[CMD_PRAY]<localtiles> (or by clicking in
the <w>command panel</w> or <w>Shift-clicking</w> on your
character)</localtiles>
to get an idea what a god offers you, and to join the faith.
If you press <w>!</w>
<localtiles>or <w>rightclick</w></localtiles>
on the religion screen, you can see a more detailed description.

Confirm your choice with an uppercase <w>Y</w>.
%%%%
tutorial5 religion

Have a look at your current religious standing with
$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_RELIGION]<localtiles>
(or via the <w>religion button</w> in the command panel,
or by <w>Shift-rightclicking</w> on the player tile)</localtiles>.
Again, pressing <w>!</w> <localtiles>or <w>rightclicking</w></localtiles>
will bring up a more detailed description of your god.
%%%%
tutorial5 piety_on_kill

Some gods really like it if you kill monsters in
their name. Let the slaughter begin!
%%%%
tutorial5 sacrificing

Praying on corpses with $cmd[CMD_PRAY]
<localtiles>or via the <w>command panel</w></localtiles>
will sacrifice them to Trog. Try it!
%%%%
tutorial5 burn_book

Trog will like it if you burn that book (with
$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]<localtiles>
or via the <w>command panel</w></localtiles>).
Sometimes, you might want to wait (with $cmd[CMD_MOVE_NOWHERE])
for a monster to step on it before doing so.
%%%%
tutorial5 berserk

Against particularly tough foes, you may want to use
Trog's Berserk power with $cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]<localtiles>
or via the <w>command panel</w></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial5 exhaustion

A berserker rage is truly exhausting. While fatigued,
you cannot berserk again and are also slowed.
It's best to rest with $cmd[CMD_REST]
<localtiles>(or via the <w>command panel</w>)</localtiles>
until you feel fit again.
%%%%
tutorial5 hunger

You cannot berserk while very hungry, so you should
always carry some food with you. This means that
sometimes you'll have to decide between butchering
a corpse or sacrificing it to Trog.
%%%%
tutorial5 berserk2

Berserk is also really useful against multiple enemies
â€” as long as you don't run out of steam in-between.

tutorial5 tutorial_end
