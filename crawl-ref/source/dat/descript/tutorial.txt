# Tutorial map 1: Movement and exploration   #
##############################################
tutorial1 start

In this lesson you're going to learn how to move around and explore a level. You can move <localtiles>by clicking somewhere with your <w>[Mouse]</w>, or </localtiles>with the <w>[arrow keys]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 go_on

You're doing great! Now, explore a bit until you reach the next blue square.
%%%%
tutorial1 diagonal

You can move diagonally by way of the <w>[number pad]</w> (try Numlock on/off) or by using the <w>[vi keys]</w>.

  Numpad:       <w>7 8 9</w>           vi-keys:    <w>$cmd[CMD_MOVE_UP_LEFT] $cmd[CMD_MOVE_UP] $cmd[CMD_MOVE_UP_RIGHT]</w>

                   \|/                         \|/

                <w>4</w>-<w>.</w>-<w>6</w>                       <w>$cmd[CMD_MOVE_LEFT]</w>-<w>.</w>-<w>$cmd[CMD_MOVE_RIGHT]</w>

                   /|\                         /|\

                <w>1 2 3</w>                       <w>$cmd[CMD_MOVE_DOWN_LEFT] $cmd[CMD_MOVE_DOWN] $cmd[CMD_MOVE_DOWN_RIGHT]</w>


<localtiles>You can also move using <w>[Mouse clicks]</w>.</localtiles>
%%%%
tutorial1 shiftmove

A quicker way to 'run' through a corridor is to press <w>[Shift]</w> along with the <w>[number pad]</w> (try Numlock on/off) or <w>[vi keys]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 downstairs

When standing on a staircase leading downwards, you can enter the next level with <w>[$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w><localtiles> or with <w>[Shift-Click]</w> on your character</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial1 levelmap

# Messy, repeating the same things for <console> and <webtiles>
What's this? To find out where you are, <tiles>have a look at the <w>minimap</w> to the right of the screen.</tiles><localtiles> You can have a closer look at a part of the map with a <w>[right mouseclick]</w> and also can travel there with a <w>[leftclick]</w>.</localtiles><webtiles>You can enter the overmap view with <w>[$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP]]</w> and then move the cursor around to look around the level.

%%%%
tutorial1 autoexplore

Exploring manually can get tedious after a while, so you might want to let that happen automatically. Try it by pressing <w>[$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 exclusion

Some dangerous ground is marked with <w>exclusions</w>. Autoexplore <localtiles>(including by <w>[mouseclick]</w>! </localtiles>will not lead you into exclusions. Instead you will automatically stop.

However, autoexplore will move you safely around exclusions so you may continue by pressing <w>[$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 autoexplore_announce

Autoexplore will stop to announce features and items. To travel directly to the stairs, you can <localtiles><w>[click]</w> on them or you can </localtiles>press <w>[$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP] << Enter]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 tutorial_end

Congratulations! You've completed the first lesson!

To exit the tutorial, simply go up these stairs with <w>[$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]]</w><localtiles> or by <w>[Shift-clicking]</w> on your character</localtiles>. Confirm the resulting prompt with an uppercase <w>[Y]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 newlevel

A new level! To begin with, head over to that door to the right.

Also, remember: You can reread old messages with <w>[$cmd[CMD_REPLAY_MESSAGES]]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 door

You can open a closed door by walking into it. To close an open door, press <w>[$cmd[CMD_CLOSE_DOOR]]</w>.
%%%%
tutorial1 secret_door_glass

It doesn't look like the corridor ends here. Try searching for a secret door with <w>[$cmd[CMD_REST]]</w>. This process might spend multiple turns.
%%%%
tutorial1 water

Note how you can move through shallow but not through deep water.
%%%%
tutorial1 secret_door_wall

A dead-end! Or, wait... is it another secret door? Try searching again with <w>[$cmd[CMD_REST]]</w> once again.
%%%%
tutorial1 upstairs

When standing on a staircase leading upwards, you can enter the previous level with <w>[$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]]</w><localtiles> or by <w>[Shift-clicking]</w> on your character</localtiles>.

# Tutorial map 5: Gods and divine abilities  #
##############################################
tutorial5 start

In this lesson you're going to learn about gods and how to use their powers.
%%%%
tutorial5 secret_door

There's got to be an entrance to the temple! Try searching
the glass walls for secret doors with <w>$cmd[CMD_REST]</w><localtiles> or
by <w>mouseclick</w> in the command panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial5 dungeon_overview

Trog is just one of many gods. In a real game, you check
<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_OVERMAP]</w><localtiles> or click on the <w>dungeon overmap
button</w> in the command panel</localtiles>
for a list of all altars and other interesting features found so far.
%%%%
tutorial5 altar

You can pray on an altar with <w>$cmd[CMD_PRAY]</w><localtiles> (or by clicking in
the <w>command panel</w> or <w>Shift-clicking</w> on your
character)</localtiles>
to get an idea what a god offers you, and to join the faith.
If you press <w>!</w>
<localtiles>or <w>rightclick</w></localtiles>
on the religion screen, you can see a more detailed description.

Confirm your choice with an uppercase <w>Y</w>.
%%%%
tutorial5 religion

Have a look at your current religious standing with
<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_RELIGION]</w><localtiles>
(or via the <w>religion button</w> in the command panel,
or by <w>Shift-rightclicking</w> on the player tile)</localtiles>.
Again, pressing <w>!</w><localtiles> or <w>rightclicking</w></localtiles>
will bring up a more detailed description of your god.
%%%%
tutorial5 piety_on_kill

Some gods really like it if you kill monsters in
their name. Let the slaughter begin!
%%%%
tutorial5 sacrificing

Praying on corpses with <w>$cmd[CMD_PRAY]</w><localtiles> or
via the <w>command panel</w></localtiles>
will sacrifice them to Trog. Try it!
%%%%
tutorial5 burn_book

Trog will like it if you burn that book (with
<w>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</w><localtiles>
or via the <w>command panel</w></localtiles>).
Sometimes, you might want to wait (with <w>$cmd[CMD_MOVE_NOWHERE]</w>)
for a monster to step on it before doing so.
%%%%
tutorial5 berserk

Against particularly tough foes, you may want to use
Trog's Berserk power with <w>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</w><localtiles>
or via the <w>command panel</w></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial5 exhaustion

A berserker rage is truly exhausting. While fatigued,
you cannot berserk again and are also slowed.
It's best to rest with <w>$cmd[CMD_REST]</w>
<localtiles>(or via the <w>command panel</w>)</localtiles>
until you feel fit again.
%%%%
tutorial5 hunger

You cannot berserk while very hungry, so you should
always carry some food with you. This means that
sometimes you'll have to decide between butchering
a corpse or sacrificing it to Trog.
%%%%
tutorial5 berserk2

Berserk is also really useful against multiple enemies
â€” as long as you don't run out of steam in-between.
%%%%
tutorial5 tutorial_end

Congratulations! You've finished the last tutorial lesson
and are now ready for the real game. Good luck!

To exit the tutorial, just go down these stairs.
