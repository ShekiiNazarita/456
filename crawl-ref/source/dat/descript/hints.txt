welcome

<white>Welcome to Dungeon Crawl!</white>

Your objective is to lead a <w>{{ return you.race() }} {{ return you.class() }}</w>
safely through the depths of the dungeon, retrieving the fabled Orb of
Zot and returning it to the surface. In the beginning, however, let discovery
be your main goal. Try to delve as deeply as possible but beware; death lurks
around every corner.

For the moment, just remember the following keys and their functions:
  <white>%?</white> - shows the items and the commands
  <white>%</white>  - saves the game, to be resumed later (but note that death is permanent)
  <white>%</white>  - examines something in your vicinity

The hint mode will help you play Crawl without reading any documentation. If
you haven't yet, you might want to try out the tutorial. Also, if you feel
intrigued, there is more information available in the following files from the
docs/ directory (all of which can also be read in-game):
  <lightblue>quickstart.txt</lightblue>     - A very short guide to Crawl.
  <lightblue>crawl_manual.txt</lightblue>   - This contains all details on species, magic, skills, etc.
  <lightblue>options_guide.txt</lightblue>  - Crawl's interface is highly configurable. This document
                       explains all the options.

Happy Crawling!

death

Condolences! Your character's premature death is a sad, but common occurrence
in Crawl. Rest assured that with diligence and playing experience your
characters will last longer.

Perhaps the following advice can improve your playing style:

death conjurer melee

As a Conjurer your main weapon should be offensive magic. Cast spells more
often! Remember to rest when your Magic is low.

death berserker unberserked

Don't forget to go berserk when fighting particularly difficult foes. It's
risky, but makes you faster and beefier.

  if you.hunger() < 3
    then return "Berserking is impossible while very hungry or worse, " ..
                "so make sure to stay fed at all times, just in case " ..
                "you need to berserk." end

death ranger melee

Your bow and arrows are extremely powerful against distant monsters. Be sure to
collect all arrows lying around in the dungeon.
