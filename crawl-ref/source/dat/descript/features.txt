A basalt altar of Yredelemnul

An altar to Yredelemnul the Dark, worked from columnar basalt.

A bloodstained altar of Trog

An altar to Trog the Wrathful, crudely made by what seem to be the hands of
giants and covered with bloodstains.
%%%%
A blossoming altar of Fedhas

An altar to Fedhas Madash, covered in vibrant and colourful plant life.
%%%%
A burning altar of Makhleb

An ever-burning altar to Makhleb the Destroyer. Strange, twisting shapes are
visible in the flames.

A wooden door, cunningly hidden. It used to be a secret door but at least for
you it's not a secret anymore.

To open it, try simply walking into it, or press 'O'.

long forgotten scripts, devoted to Sif Muna the Loreminder.
%%%%
A dry fountain

A dried-up fountain that has seen better days.
%%%%
A flagged portal

This portal leads to a forbidden dungeon of the mad chevalier. You know this
because of the black pennant bearing weapons in saltire. It seems as if you had
better enter the portal before the standard is lowered to the ground.

Press 'q' to drink from this fountain. Not that it would have any effect,
though...
%%%%
A fountain of blood

Press 'q' to drink from this fountain, if you absolutely wish to.

%%%%
A one-way gate leading to the halls of Pandemonium

This gate leads to the endless halls of Pandemonium. Tales about successful
lootings of these netherworlds are rare. Even the strongest and most
experienced characters can die there. On the other hand, these halls contain
several runes and lots of valuable items. It is much easier to get in than to
get out.
%%%%
A gas trap

You're lucky to have noticed this trap, for it would have released a cloud of
deadly gas at you. Exactly what gas it holds, you cannot tell â€” perhaps it is
plain poison, perhaps mutagenic fumes, perhaps flammable vapour, or perhaps
something yet nastier.
%%%%
A gate to the Realm of Zot

This gate leads to the Realm of Zot, the final stage of your quest as its
deepest level houses the infamous Orb of Zot. Both the Orb and this Realm have
a fearsome and questionable reputation, but one piece of information seems to
be for certain: The monsters inhabiting this area and protecting the Orb are
strong and strange - some of them nowhere encountered but here.
%%%%
A gateway to a bazaar

Aside from the vendors who've set up their stores at various places in the
dungeon, there are others trying to make a living by traveling from place to
place. Bazaars feature a number of different shops and often have better stock
than the sedentary ones, sometimes even at a bargain.

Also be warned that their nomadic lifestyle has taught these sellers to
appropriate any items an adventurer might leave behind, and then leave quickly,
probably to sell them elsewhere.
%%%%
A gateway leading out of the Abyss

A gateway out of this accursed place, shimmering and shifting in the
impermanent landscape.
%%%%
A gateway to a ziggurat

untold riches.

A gateway to the ashen valley of Gehenna

You can feel the heat. Gehenna seems to be made out of nothing but flames, lava
and hellfire.

Who will stand the test of iron?

%%%%
A gateway to the freezing wastes of Cocytus

From the frost-bitten lands, a cold chill touches your soul.
%%%%
A glowing drain

Every settlement brings forth the unpleasant sewers and drains, ignored by most
but hideaways for others. Old tales speak of dangerous creatures, bathing in
disgustingly green water, preying on each other without mercy. The tales also
tell of the valuable items left by daring and unfortunate visitors, left to
collect dust in the damp caverns. You have an uncanny feeling that the drain
will fall apart rather soon.
%%%%
A glowing golden altar of the Shining One

An altar to the Shining One, made from the purest gold and almost blinding in
its radiance.
%%%%
A glowing silver altar of Zin

An altar to Zin the Law-Giver, made from silver as pristine as Zin's followers
are expected to be, and glowing gently.
%%%%
A granite statue

Despite the hardness of the stone, this statue's features have long withered
away.
%%%%
A hole to the Spider Nest

This is more of a natural sloped shaft than a stairway, but it will do. If you
want to die from most potent venoms of this world, that is.
%%%%
A labyrinth entrance

A gateway to an intricate maze designed by subtle and malicious minds, its exit
guarded by a fearsome monster. Many a hapless adventurer has lost his way in
the twisted, shifting passages, and starved to death.
%%%%
A magical trap

A magical device designed to harm trespassers that can't be deactivated.
%%%%
A mechanical trap

A mechanical contraption designed to harm trespassers. A skilled adventurer can
try to disarm it, though.
%%%%
A natural trap

A natural hazard, although it looks almost as if designed to harm trespassers.
%%%%
A metal wall

A wall of bluish-grey metal. As every dungeon electrician knows, this stuff
will ground.
%%%%
A needle trap

It is damn sure the needles from this trap are doused in something nasty.
%%%%
A one-way gate to the infinite horrors of the Abyss

A one-way gate to a demon-haunted realm, riven by chaos, its very substance
impermanent and whimsical, filled with creatures out of nightmare.
%%%%
A passage of Golubria

This unstable gateway allows instantaneous travel to another nearby passage of
Golubria, and will close behind anything passing through it.
%%%%
A portal to somewhere

A gash-like tear in reality that looks into some terrifying, starry otherworld.
Thankfully, the magic that opened this portal prevents its vacuum from
consuming and swallowing everything in sight.
%%%%
A radiant altar of Vehumet

An altar, ablaze in the lights of Iskenderun and promising great destructive
powers to those who would follow Vehumet.
%%%%
A rock wall

This wall consists of simple rock.

beyond.

An altar to Beogh, unmistakably roughly hewn by orcish artisans.
%%%%
A sand-covered staircase

You can make out a staircase leading downwards into a small tomb. Sand
surrounds the staircase and is continuously pouring onto it. Before long, the
staircase will be gone. They say that some distant relatives of the pharaohs
were entombed here.
%%%%
A shaft

A deep hole. Who knows where you might end up if you were to fall through it?
%%%%
A shattered altar of Ashenzari

This crystal altar shattered to pieces when Ashenzari was cursed. But still,
there is power here: a dark aura holds the shards in mid-explosion, suspended
in time and space much like the god they herald.
%%%%
A shimmering altar of Xom

This altar constantly shimmers in all visible colours and probably some
invisible ones, too, matching the whims of Xom the Unpredictable, to whom it is
dedicated.
%%%%
A shop

A shop in the dungeon, beyond sight of the world above, manned by a secretive
and reclusive shopkeeper who cannot be bargained with, grants no refunds, and
is interested in nothing you may have to sell. Some shops hawk antiques of
unknown provenance, and offer little hint as to the quality or nature of their
goods.
%%%%
A slime covered rock wall

This rock wall is thickly coated with bright green slime. Ewwwwww.
%%%%
A snail-covered altar of Cheibriados

This altar somehow seems more stationary than the others.
%%%%

attract followers for Nemelex Xobeh.

kind of stuff. Also taxes and whatever else you ran from.

Climbing these stairs will end your quest, whether you carry the Orb with
you or not.
%%%%
A staircase to the Crypt

These stairs lead to an ancient crypt. Unfortunately, not everything that was
buried there had the decency to stay dead.
%%%%
A staircase to the Ecumenical Temple

An entrance to a temple of Gods, a place of peace and refuge from the insanity
of the dungeon.
%%%%
A staircase to the Elven Halls

A wide stair down to the murky depths of the halls of the deep elves, skilled
warriors with blades and bows, and fearsome sorcerers and magicians.
%%%%
A staircase to the Hall of Blades

These stairs lead to the Hall of Blades. The steps seem to have been beaten and
chipped by assaults from the animated weapons therein.
%%%%
A staircase to the Lair

These stairs lead down to the Lair of Beasts, for a change of climate.
%%%%
A staircase to the Orcish Mines

An entrance to the mines of the orcs, filled with their gold, but treacherous

%%%%
A staircase to the Dwarven Hall

An entrance to the well-worked hall of the dwarves. You think you can smell
ale.
%%%%
A staircase to the Enchanted Forest

An entrance to the spriggan forest. Snap a twig and you're dead. Actually, they
won't wait until you do that.
%%%%
A staircase to the Shoals

Here be the Shoals: exotic underground beaches, salty spray and creatures that
bite, stab and maul.
%%%%
A staircase to the Slime Pits

They are sprinkled with spots of blood.
%%%%
A stone staircase leading down

walls.

Stepping on this teleporter will send you to another room.
%%%%
A translucent rock wall

The mineral this rock consists of is as translucent as good quality glass.
Whether it is natural or magical, you can't tell.
%%%%
A translucent stone wall

A harder obstacle than rock walls. Only the mightiest magic can shatter stone
walls. It has been imbued with arcane magics which render it translucent.
%%%%
A translucent unnaturally hard rock wall

This wall is imbued with magic that not only makes it indestructible but also
makes it translucent like glass.
%%%%
A trap

It's a trap!
%%%%
A tree

While the dungeon is filled with dim magic light, in most places it is not
bright enough to sustain any larger plants. It is uneven, though, and there are
spots where, with the grace of Fedhas, trees as big as those on the surface can
grow underground.
%%%%
A viscous altar of Jiyva

A slimy, ever-shifting altar to Jiyva. You're not sure what it's made from, and
you don't really want to know.
%%%%
A wall of green crystal

For some reason, some dungeon walls, like this one, have been made of this
polished crystal, imbued with arcane magics. They prevent its easy destruction,
and make it reflect heat and cold.
%%%%
A wall of solid wax

These walls are built by bees. Occasionally a dungeon architect will manipulate
bees into building wax walls for aesthetic reasons. (Theirs, not the bees'.)
They are susceptible to fire and will melt and burn, given sufficient heat.
%%%%
A wall of the weird stuff which makes up Pandemonium

This wall is made from the weird stuff which makes up Pandemonium, but seems to
be like rock in most other aspects.
%%%%
A white marble altar of Elyvilon

An altar to Elyvilon the Healer, made from purest white marble and topped by a
sculpture of the Chalice of Purification.
%%%%
A web

The spider who left this web must have been huge, as it seems to be made for
trapping {{ return you.genus(true) }} rather than flies.
%%%%
An abandoned shop

This shop has been abandoned.
%%%%
An alarm trap

While this trap does no damage by itself, its loud sound may bring someone to
do damage to you. Of course, you have the option to do damage to those someones
yourself.
%%%%
An ancient bone altar of Kikubaaqudgha

Ancient bones were piled here to form an altar to the terrible Demon-God
Kikubaaqudgha.
%%%%

If you ever wanted to escape out of the pan into the fire, this is your chance.
This gateway allows you to return from this place via a nice scenic path
through infinite madness.
%%%%
An iron altar of Okawaru

An altar of iron and steel dedicated to the Warmaster Okawaru. Its edges are
surprisingly sharp.
%%%%
An iron grate

This iron grate looks rusted, as if it could be disrupted with a spell or a
wand quite easily. It's too strong to be breakable by hand, though.
%%%%
An open door

A wooden door. You can close it by standing next to it and {{
    if crawl.is_tiles() then
        return "either doing Ctrl-L-Click on the door or pressing 'C'."
    else
        return "pressing 'C'."
    end

%%%%
An unnaturally hard rock wall

You cannot affect this wall by any means.
%%%%
An unnaturally hard stone wall

This stone wall is harder than... stone. In fact, there's exactly nothing you
can do about it.
%%%%
The endless lava

A sea of fire and brimstone that goes as far as you can see. Which is not far
because of thick smoke.

Unlike small pools of lava where flight or levitation may allow short trips,
floating above this inferno would cook you in no time thanks to runaway
convection.
%%%%
A floor

Dungeon floor.
%%%%
Some deep water

This water is as deep as it is dangerous. No sane traveller would try to set
foot into it, apart from those who fly or swim. Let it be a warning for you:
many confused adventurers found their death at the depths, and an untimely end
of levitation drowned even more hopeful trespassers.
%%%%
Some lava

An intensely hot pool of molten rock, emitting clouds of sulphurous smoke.
%%%%
Some shallow water

This waist-deep, misty water makes movement and combat cumbersome for
landlubbers - sometimes dangerous, but never directly fatal.
%%%%
The open sea

Nothing but endless wind and waves, and not a lighthouse in sight. You'd be
lost beyond all hope in short order - better not risk it.

# wizlab: Wucad Mu
An autumnal tree

These trees, large as they are, appear to be permanently locked in an autumnal
moment: leaves, coloured red and gold, fall from branches and float gracefully
to the floor. Before they even reach the ground, however, a shadow passes, and
when the shimmer is gone, the leaves are once more on the branch, ready to fall
again.
%%%%
A crumbled stone wall

These walls, though they have fallen into disrepair, appear as locked in time
as the trees, ready to collapse, but utterly unable to.

The ground

On the edge of this tiny, isolated plane, space itself dissolves into oblivion.

# timed bazaar
A flickering gateway to a bazaar

Aside from the vendors who've set up their stores at various places in the
dungeon, there are others trying to make a living by traveling from place to
place. Bazaars feature a number of different shops and often have better stock
than the sedentary ones, sometimes even at a bargain. Once you hear the
clinking of coins, be sure to hurry up and find the impromptu marketplace
before the caravan moves on!

Also be warned that their nomadic lifestyle has taught these sellers to

Also be warned that their nomadic lifestyle has taught these sellers to

A gateway to a hive

You hear a manifold buzzing. The waxy walls of this place are dripping with
honey, but the larvae are hungry, and the queen bee will not tolerate
intruders.
%%%%
A frozen archway

A permanent cold front seems to surround this portal. Whatever lives on the
other side will be full of grim and arctic fury. You note that the archway is
melting away.
%%%%
A sand-covered staircase

You can make out a staircase leading downwards into a small tomb. Sand
surrounds the staircase and is continuously pouring onto it. Before long, the

%%%%
A portal to a secret trove of treasure

Once upon a time, an enterprising thief and wizard, terrified of being caught
committing an act of burglary, created a system of portals leading into the
secret treasure troves and chambers of the rich. Too scared to loot them
himself, he instead charged an extortionate fee for entry to anyone who wanted
to rifle through them.

The secrets of the gateways died with him when his fellow thieves, disgusted by
his betrayal of their 'ideals', had him murdered. With his death, the
now-uncontrolled portals began moving rapidly from one dimension to the next,
stopping only long enough to absorb magical energy.
%%%%
A dark tunnel

Leading directly into the rock is a dark and forbidding tunnel. Every so often,
air hot enough to singe your face blasts from within, and, as though triggered
by the air, rocks fall from the roof and sides of the tunnel, slowly filling
the entry.
%%%%
A magical portal

This portal has been left open by a careless wizard. It might lead to a secret
laboratory, but beware! Surely it will be guarded by magical traps and terrible
monsters. It seems to be slowly fading away.

# sprint_mu
An open sea?

Though it exists in stark defiance of every conventional rule of physics and

Either that, or it's a blue wall.
