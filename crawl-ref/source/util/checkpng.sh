# This is a script to de-interlace, compress and fix all the PNG images of DSCC (https://github.com/crawl/crawl/)
# Hint: This script is able to convert images in any project, not just crawl
#
# It uses the OptiPNG command line tool which you need to install first
# To install it, download the source at http://optipng.sourceforge.net/ and compile it:
#
# Build instructions
# ------------------
#   On Unix, or under a Bourne-compatible shell, run ./configure and make:
#        cd optipng-0.7.7/
#        ./configure
#        make
#        make test
#
#  Alternatively, use a pre-configured makefile that matches your compiler;
#  e.g.:
#        cd optipng-0.7.7/
#        nmake -f build/visualc.mk
#        nmake -f build/visualc.mk test
#
# Before you run this script, you need to set the variables to point to the correct directories and files:
#
#	CRAWLDIR    [ the directory containing the crawl images ]
#	OPTIPNG     [ the path to the binary of OptiPNG ]
#	LOG_FILE    [ the log file to use if parameter -l is given ]
#
# The script has the following parameters which are optional:
#	-n [no change, only report]
#	-m [only check modified files in the git index] (not working yet)
#	-l [ write standard out to a logfile ]
#
# In order to run the script you need to set the executable bit
# chmod +x ./checkpng.sh
# once and the run it
#
# Examples:
#
#	./checkpng.sh -l     - Run the real thing, logged to LOG_FILE (recommended)
#	./checkpng.sh -n -l  - Run reports only, logged to LOG_FILE
#	./checkpng.sh -n     - Run reports only with thousands of lines flying by
#	./checkpng.sh        - Run the real thing with thousands of lines flying by
