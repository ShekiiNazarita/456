Building on Windows (MSYS2)
---------------------------

MSYS2 which is a Cygwin-derived software distro for Windows that can build
native applications. We recommend Windows users try this method first for
compiling crawl, since it is tested by our active Windows developers. You can
download the MSYS2 installer from the following website:

https://msys2.github.io/

You generally want to install the 64-bit version of MSYS2 unless you have a
specific reason to build a 32-bit version of crawl. Follow all of the steps you
see on that page to install MSYS2, but please read the additional notes below.
In particular, when starting the MSYS2 Shell, be sure to run the 64-bit MinGW
version of MSYS2 and *not* the version labeled 'MSYS2 MSYS'.

* The installer will put all MSYS2/MinGW files into a folder of your choice,
  which defaults to 'C:\msys64'. If you have crawl-related work files from
  other directories that you'd like to carry over, you can copy them into
  'C:\msys64\home\<Username>', where <Username> is your Windows username. This
  is the path to your home directory in this new MSYS2 installation.

* After the installer finishes, you'll want to start the MSYS2 Shell to follow
  steps 5-7 in order to update your installation. Be sure to use the menu entry
  that's labeled MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit and *not* the one labeled 'MSYS2 MSYS'.
  After each update step, restart the MSYS2 shell before the next step.

After MSYS2 is fully installed and updated, follow steps below to install
development packages and compile Crawl. The commands shown below should be run
from within the MSYS2 Shell.

* To install git and the base development packages, run:

  pacman -S base-devel git

  Accept the default action to install all packages in base-devel, and say yes
  to any questions about installing packages or removing packages due to
  conflicts.

* To install the mingw-w64 GCC toolchain for your system, run:

  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

  After the packages install, you're ready to build crawl!

* To get the Crawl source, you can follow the steps in the Source Code Checkout
  section above to clone Crawl into your MSYS2 home directory. If you've
  downloaded the source elsewhere, first 'cd' to that Crawl source directory.
  For example, if you have the Crawl sources in c:\crawl\source, you would run:

  cd /c/crawl/source

* Build the console version of Crawl by simply running:

  make

  If you want a graphical build, you will need to run add 'TILES=y':

  make TILES=y

* When the build process finishes, you can run crawl.exe directly from the
  source directory in the MSYS2 shell. For Tiles, type './crawl', and for
  console, type 'start crawl', which will open Crawl in a new console window
  (necessary for it to run properly). Both versions can also be started by
  double-clicking crawl.exe using the graphical file explorer.
