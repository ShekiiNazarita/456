    What is the GitHub URL for your branch's commits?  This will look something like: https://github.com/neilmoore/crawl/commits/test-commit (Links to an external site.)

    
  
    You can find the URL by going to your team's GitHub repository on the web, selecting the branch from the drop-down list in the upper left, then clicking on the number of commits that appears just above the directory listing, on the right-hand side.  Alternatively, you can form the URL yourself by following the example above: replace "neilmoore" with the repository owner, "crawl" with the repository name, and "test-commit" with the branch.

    What platform(s), compiler, and build flags (TILES, WEBTILES, FULLDEBUG, etc.) did you use for testing?
